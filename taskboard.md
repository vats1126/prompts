## 4. Feature Creep Prevention & Guardrails

To prevent the team from getting trapped in secondary features:
- ❌ **No custom user registration flows**: Use pre-seeded local personas for demo.
- ❌ **No cloud video rendering or diffusion models**: Use CSS/SVG graphics.
- ❌ **No second backend language**: 100% fullstack Next.js TypeScript.
- ❌ **No complex auth permission middleware**: Simple role switcher in dev header.
- ❌ **No open-ended free chat with AI**: AI is strictly queried via bounded single-turn structured schema tasks.
